# Bamazon

This app is an Amazon-like storefront with options for use as the store customer, manager, or supervisor. As a customer, the app takes in orders and depletes stock from the store's inventory. As a manager, the app gives the options of viewing, restocking, and adding to the store's inventory. As a supervisor, the app tracks product sales across the store's departments and then provides a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
